# namebb
It's been a real pain to pick a name for our baby, so i built this tool to random generate 
names from commonly used chinese characters and rank them based on the mysterious "rules" I
found online.

This tool is built with Flask and JQuery Mobile, and can be accessed at:

chenliang.info/name

Also,

IT'S A GIRL !!!!!

Thanks and give my respect.

And I made some modifications to adapt to Python3. Now this project can work under Python3 env.
